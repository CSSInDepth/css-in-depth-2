# CSS in Depth, 2nd edition

Code listings from [CSS In Depth, second edition](https://www.manning.com/books/css-in-depth-second-edition?a_aid=kjg&a_bid=a7bc24da) by Keith J. Grant

Note: this repository is still a work in progress; many listings have been copied from the first edition and are not yet updated. These listing are complete for chapters that have been released in the MEAP, but late chapters are somewhat out of date.

At first glance, it may appear that some listings are missingâ€”Because working examples requires both HTML and CSS, I have put most listings in an HTML file, using <style> tags for the CSS. This means that both an HTML listing and CSS listing are combined in one file in the repository.

For example, in Chapter 1, listing 1.1 is HTML code and listing 1.2 is CSS that is meant to be applied to that HTML. I have included these both in the repository in the file named ch01/listing-1.2.html. Changes are made to this CSS in ch01/listing 1.3; these are included in ch01/listing-1.3.html, along with the corresponding HTML from listing 1.1.
